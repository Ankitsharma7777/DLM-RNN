# DLM-RNN
The dlm_rnn project is a deep learning project focused on applying Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sentiment analysis, specifically analyzing Twitter data. This project leverages RNNs to understand the sentiment of tweets, particularly in domains like customer feedback, where textual data often involves sequential patterns.
